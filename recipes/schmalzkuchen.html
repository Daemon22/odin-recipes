<p id=description>Schmalzkuchen for a different donut experience!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g All-Purpose Flour, plus extra for rolling out dough</li>
        <li>125ml Milk, warmed</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Dry Yeast, active</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Vanilla Sugar, or an additional tablespoon of Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Butter, unsalted</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tsp Lemon Zest</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp Salt</li>
        <li>2 inches Oil, for deep-frying</li>
        <li>Confectioner's Sugar, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flour in a bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour the warm milk into the well, sprinkle the yeast on top, and add a pinch of the sugar. Stir the milk a little, then cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>When the milk mixture begins to foam, add the egg, the remaining granulated sugar, the vanilla sugar, butter, lemon zest, and salt. Mix with a large spoon, or in an electric mixer with a dough hook, until the dough comes together to form a ball. Add a little more flour, if needed.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until a soft, smooth ball can be formed. Grease or oil the ball, place in a small container and let rise, covered, for 20 minutes or so. (The dough will rise slightly.)</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a cutting board and pat the dough into a rectangle. Roll out into 1/2-inch (1-centimeter) thick. Using a pizza cutter or bench knife, cut the dough into rectangles (or diamonds), roughly 1 x 1 1/2 inches (2 x 3 centimeters).</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a stockpot or other large, deep saucepan. (If you are using a deep-fat fryer, follow manufacturer's instructions.) The oil should be heated to 365 F. Use a deep-fat fry thermometer to check.</li>
        <li>Fry the donuts in 4 to 5 batches for 1 1/2 minutes, or until the underside turns golden brown. Turn them (only once!) and fry for an additional 1 1/2 minutes until golden brown on the other side.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels or a brown paper bag.</li>
        <li>Sift confectioners' sugar over the top and eat while still warm.</li>
        <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
